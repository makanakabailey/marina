## 🎯 The Core Strategy: "The Cost of Silence"

When presenting this prototype, your goal is to show the client that **every day without this site is a day they are losing money.**

### 1. The Hero Section: "The First Impression"
**The Pitch:** "Look at this on your phone. This is what a CEO sees when they search for a venue. It doesn't just look good; it signals that Marina is the *only* choice for a world-class event."
**The Pain:** "If they see a slow, non-responsive site, they assume your service is slow and non-responsive. Can you afford that assumption?"

### 2. The Role Selector: "Operational Freedom"
**The Pitch:** "We've built 6 downloadable resources—planner kits and menus—that save your clients 40% of their planning time. They don't have to call you for every detail; they have the tools to say 'Yes' right now."
**The Pain:** "Without this, your sales team is stuck answering the same questions 50 times a week. That's hours of high-value time wasted on low-value tasks."

### 3. The Dining & Casino Sections: "The Hook"
**The Pitch:** "We're not just selling a room; we're selling an ecosystem. The casino and premium dining are your unique edges. We've positioned them to be the 'hook' that keeps guests at Marina long after the event ends."
**The Pain:** "If you don't showcase these, you're just another conference room. You're competing on price instead of prestige."

## 🛑 The Regret Factor: What Happens if They Don't Act?

Use these talking points to drive urgency:

*   **Lost Leads:** "Every minute this site isn't live, a high-value lead is booking with a competitor because their site was easier to navigate on mobile."
*   **Brand Erosion:** "Harare is growing. If Marina isn't positioned as the digital leader now, you'll be playing catch-up for the next three years."
*   **The May Event Opportunity:** "We are building an ecosystem. If you miss the May event partnership, you miss the chance to be the hub of this new business nexus."

## 🚀 Presentation Script: The "Close"

"We've already built 85% of this. It's not a 'project' anymore; it's a finished asset waiting for your green light. For $600—a fraction of the market cost—we launch this, optimize it for the May event, and start driving real revenue. 

**Do we launch this week and start winning, or do we stay Harare's best-kept secret?**"
